## :star2: Description
" **SUPER MoM** " is a web service for mothers who are not so familiar for searching because of inexperienced search skills and trends.

* The website receives information from the **user (mothers)**, as well as the input of the **child's** information.
* The server extracts the postings of the **Naver blog post based on the user's information**. The server outputs the most appropriate search results to the user's view.
* And The server removes the factors that let users worry about the results of the search. 
* The keywords that appear as a search result are calculated by using their own algorithm.
* The server then checks the frequency of the observed keyword and arranges it in descending order.
* Users can be provided **a better growth environment for their children** by using the information that the server has printed on the screen.
